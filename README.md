# python-extract-script
extracting isscripts or scripts from (SFCC) isml and putting them in txt file for review and change, also creating a txt file with log of how many files were scanned and how many scripts were extracted

Long story short I had to go and extract all the scripts tags from pt ismls in our SFCC project and since im lazy I've created a script to do it. The one I uploaded is version 2 which is more clean and extracting isscripts because I just change it to see how many it will get. 
It's nice little experiment that maybe someone can use if they are doing refactoring of their SFCC project and want to clean some scripts or isscripts logic
